# ATU Bsc (Hons) in Software Development: 
# Emerging Technologies Assessment 22/23
### Alexandra Cotter G00385851

My assessment work for the module Emerging Technologies is contained within this repository. 
There are 5 Jupyter Notebooks, each detailing their own topic. Topics include HTTP, JupyterLite, Computation, Fourier Transform & Quantum Computing. A contents section at the top of each notebook highlights the sub-topics of the notebook.

You can view the JupyterLite instance created from this repository here:
[alexandrac77.github.io/emerging-technologies](https://alexandrac77.github.io/emerging-technologies/
GitHub Actions automatically builds & deploys the JupyterLite instance to GitHub Pages.
